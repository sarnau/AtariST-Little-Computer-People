/*
 * dat_games.c -- the initialized globals that belong to the games
 * object, in the original's data order.
 *
 * The 1985 sources declared their globals in the file that used them,
 * so each object's data segment is its own globals followed by the
 * string literals and switch tables its code emits.  The position of
 * this file's #include and the order of the declarations below set
 * the data layout; do not reorder them.
 *
 * Not compiled standalone -- included by games.c.
